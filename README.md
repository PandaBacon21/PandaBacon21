# Hello There, my name is Josh. 


My background is a little unusual in this space. In a past life, I served as an infantryman in the Marine Corps. I then spent the next part of my career in sales before earning the opportunity to move into a Solutions Engineer position. I now work for Zoom as a Senior Solutions Engineer and while I am responsible for knowing and supporting all Zoom products, a key area of my focus revolves around our healthcare integrations. 

I went back to school and earned a Graduate Certificate in Data Science and have continued to expand on the knowledge gained in that course. Before the data science program and since finishing that program, I have been mostly self-taught. This has been very rewarding but is also a challenge, as I have not had the opportunity to learn from others in the same way as you would on a team, or work on larger projects beyond my own. 

Most of what I have used my Github for has been school-related in the past, but I am working to add some new repositories to help show some examples of how to integrate with Zoom, along with other various projects of interest. I also plan to expand on some data science projects that I had worked on previously as time permits. 

As mentioned, while I spend much of my time around API integrations, I don't spend all day coding or building projects for job and welcome feedback from anyone who stumbles upon my projects. 

I may go back and add more to this README in the future, but for now, thanks for reading.
