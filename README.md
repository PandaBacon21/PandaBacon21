## Hello There, my name is Josh. 


I recently completed my Graduate Certificate in Data Science and GitHub has mostly been used for various assignments associated to that course. Now that the course is over, I plan to begin working on various side projects as I have time.

I plan to continue working on some data science projects but I also want to shift my focus to learn how to actually design systems from more of a software development perspective and not just using code for data science. This includes learning additional languages beyond Python and SQL such as JavaScript as well as expanding what little I currently know of HTML/CSS. 

I do not specifically do any of this for my day-to-day job and welcome any/all thoughts feedback as this is all mostly just a hobby for me.
