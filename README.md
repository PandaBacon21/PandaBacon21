# Hello There, my name is Josh. 


My background is a little unusual in this space. In a past life, I served as an infantryman in the Marine Corps and I couldn't have told you a thing about computers. I then spent the next part of my career in sales before earning the opportunity to move into a Solutions Engineer position. I now work for Zoom as a Solutions Engineer and while I am responsible for knowing and supporting all Zoom products, a key area of my focus revolves around our healthcare integrations. 

I went back to school and earned a Graduate Certificate in Data Science and have continued to expand on the knowledge gained in that course. Before the data science program and since finishing that program, I have been mostly self-taught. This has been very rewarding but is also a challenge, as I have not had the opportunity to learn from others or work on larger projects beyond my own. 

Most of what I have used my Github for has been school-related, but I am working to add some new repositories to help show some examples of how to integrate with Zoom. I also plan to expand on some data science projects that I had worked on previously. 

As mentioned, while I spend much of my time around API integrations, I don't spend my day coding or building projects for work. That said, I welcome all feedback from anyone who stumbles upon my projects. 

I may go back and add more to this README in the future, but for now, thanks for reading.
