## Hello There, my name is Josh. 


I have been completing a Graduate Certificate in Data Science and GitHub has mostly been used for various assignments.

As that program ends, I am planning to continue learning on my own, as time allows. My hope is to keep updating this with new projects and updating old projects. 

I welcome any/all thoughts feedback as I am still new to this world overall.
